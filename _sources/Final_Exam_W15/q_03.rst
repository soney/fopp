   Assume you are given two files. **SherlockHolmes.txt** contains the first 1000 letters (omitting spaces and punctuation) of “Sherlock Holmes”, all converted to lower case. **Rand.txt** also contains 1000 letters but each letter is randomly selected from lower case letters. If you run a text compression on both files, which compressed file should we expect to be **shorter** and why?
