   Does the following code snippet result in an infinite loop (meaning that the while loop never stops running)?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      e = 15
      while e < 50:
         print ('E')

   ..

   -   Yes

       +   Correct! At first, e = 15. However, in each iteration, e is never updated. So, it will never be greater than or equal to 50.

   -   No

       -   Incorrect! At first, e = 15. However, in each iteration, e is never updated. So, it will never be greater than or equal to 50.
