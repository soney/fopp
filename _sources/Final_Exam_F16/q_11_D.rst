   Does the following code snippet result in an infinite loop (meaning that the while loop never stops running)?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      d = 14
      while d < 40:
         d = 4
         print ('D')
         d = d + 4

   ..

   -   Yes

       +   Correct! At first, d = 14. However, in each iteration, d = 4 at the beginning of the iteration and then increases to 8 at the end. So, it will never be greater than or equal to 40.

   -   No

       -   Incorrect! At first, d = 14. However, in each iteration, d = 4 at the beginning of the iteration and then increases to 8 at the end. So, it will never be greater than or equal to 40.
