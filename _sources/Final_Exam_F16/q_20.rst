    You write some code for your own purposes. It’s been very useful for you and you start to
    get requests from other people to share it. You don’t mind sharing it freely, but you decide
    that it would bother you very much if somebody else started selling your code and keeping
    the money for themselves. What kind of license should you put on your code when you
    distribute it: GPL or BSD? Justify your answer in 2–3 sentences.

    ..

    -   GPL

        +   Correct!

    -   BSD

        -   Incorrect!
