    You have written a small UNIX utility program (analogous to cat or grep)
    for your own purposes. It’s been very useful for you and you start to get requests
    from other people to share it. You don’t mind sharing it freely, but you decide
    that it would bother you very much if somebody else started selling your code
    and keeping the money for themselves. What kind of license should you put on
    your code when you distribute it: GPL or BSD? Justify your answer in 2‐3
    sentences.

    ..

    -   GPL

        +   Correct!

    -   BSD

        -   Incorrect!
