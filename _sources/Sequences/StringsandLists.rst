Strings and Lists
=================

Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or phrases that we
wanted to print out. Our definition was simple: a string is simply some characters inside quotes.
In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail.

Additionally, we explore lists, which are very much like strings but can hold different types.


Strings

Strings can be defined as sequential collections of characters.  This means that the individual
characters that make up a string are in a particular order from left to right.

A string that contains no characters, often referred to as the **empty string**, is still considered
to be a string. It is simply a sequence of zero characters and is represented by '' or "" (two single
or two double quotes with nothing in between).

Lists
-----

A **list** is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
index. The values that make up a list are called its **elements**. Lists are similar to strings, which
are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for
any one list, the items can be of different types.

There are several ways to create a new list.  The simplest is to enclose the
elements in square brackets ( ``[`` and ``]``).

.. sourcecode:: python

    [10, 20, 30, 40]
    ["spam", "bungee", "swallow"]

The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three
strings. As we said above, the elements of a list don't have to be the same type.  The following
list contains a string, a float, an integer, and
another list.

.. sourcecode:: python

    ["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]


.. note:: WP: Don't Mix Types!

    You'll likely see us do this in the textbook to give you odd combinations, but when you create lists you
    should generally not mix types together. A list of just strings or just integers or just floats is generally
    easier to deal with.

Tuples
------

A **tuple**, like a list, is a sequence of items of any type. The printed representation of a tuple is a comma-separated
sequence of values, enclosed in parentheses. In other words, the representation is just like lists, except with
parentheses () instead of square brackets [].

One way to create a tuple is to write an expression, enclosed in parentheses,
that consists of multiple other expressions, separated by commas.

.. sourcecode:: python

    julia = ("Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia")

The key difference between lists and tuples is that a tuple is immutable, meaning that its contents can't be changed after the tuple is
created. We will examine the mutability of lists in detail in the chapter on :ref:`Mutability <mutability>`.

To create a tuple with a single element (but you're probably not likely to do that too often), we have to include the
final comma, because without the final comma, Python treats the ``(5)`` below as an integer in parentheses:

.. activecode:: ac5_2_1

    t = (5,)
    print(type(t))

    x = (5)
    print(type(x))


**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: question5_2_1
   :answer_a: False
   :answer_b: True
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, unlike strings, lists can consist of any type of Python data.
   :feedback_b: Lists are heterogeneous, meaning they can have different types of data.
   :practice: T

   A list can contain only integer items.
