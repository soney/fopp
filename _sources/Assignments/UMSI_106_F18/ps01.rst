Problem Set 1
=============

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **Save & Run** for each one. That will  *run* your code, so you can see the output, if any, and the result of the tests, if there are any. It will also *save* your code. You should run your code each time you want to save it. You can then load the history of the code you have run and saved. The *last* code you have saved for each problem by the deadline is what will be graded.

    The following code asks the user to enter two numbers. Write code that assigns the average of the two numbers that the user entered to the variable ``avg``.
    Hint: remember that ``input()`` always returns a string. Use ``float()`` to cast the value as a float.
    ~~~~

    **10.** There are a couple functions we're giving you in this problem set. One is a function called ``greeting``, which takes any string and adds ``"Hello, "`` in front of it. (You can see examples in the code.) Another one is a function called ``random_digit``, which returns any random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). (You can also see examples in the code.)

    Write code that assigns the **function** ``greeting`` (without executing the function) to the variable ``func_var``.

    Then, write code that assigns the **return value** from executing the function ``random_digit`` to the variable ``new_digit``.

    Then, write code that assigns the **function** ``random_digit`` (without executing the function) to the variable ``digit_func``.
    ~~~~
    # For example
    print(greeting("Jackie"))
    print(greeting("everybody"))
    print(greeting("sdgadgsal"))

    # Try running all this code more than once, so you can see how calling the function
    # random_digit works.
    print(random_digit())
    print(random_digit())

    # Write code that assigns the variables as mentioned in the instructions.

    **11.** There is a function we have defined that takes two strings as inputs, and returns the length of both of those strings added together. It's called called ``add_lengths``. We are also including the functions from Problem Set 1 called ``random_digit`` and ``square`` in this problem set.

    Next, **answer the following code and related questions, in this code window**.
    ~~~~
    new_str = "'Twas brillig"

    y = add_lengths("receipt","receive")

    x = random_digit()

    z = new_str.find('b')

    l = new_str.find("'")

    # notice that this line of code is made up of a lot of different expressions
    fin_value = square(len(new_str)) + (z - l) + (x * random_digit())

    # DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE ABOVE THIS LINE
    # But below here, putting print statements and running the code may help you!

    # The following questions are based on that code. All refer to the types of the
    #variables and/or expressions after the above code is run.

    #####################

    # Write a comment explaining each of the following, after each question.
    # Don't forget to press **run** to save once you've done this!

    # What is square?

    # What type of object does the expression square(len(new_str)) evaluate to?

    # What type is z?

    # What type is l?

    # What type is the expression z-l?

    # What type is x?

    # What is random_digit? How many inputs does it take?

    # What type does the expression x * random_digit() evaluate to?

    # Given all this information, what type will fin_value hold once all this code is run?

    Assign the value of the sixth element of ``num_lst`` to a variable called ``elem_sixth``.

    Assign the length of ``num_lst`` to a variable called ``num_lst_len``.

    :topics: PythonTurtle/OurFirstTurtleProgram

    **13.** Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It doesn't have to be complicated, but draw something different than we did in the textbook or in class. (Optional but encouraged: post a screenshot of the artistic outcome to the discussion board, or a short video of the drawing as it is created.) (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting ``.speed(10)`` for the turtle to draw fast, or ``.speed(0)`` for it to draw super fast with no animation.)
